Titanic Dataset Analysis
The Titanic dataset is one of the most renowned datasets in the data science community. It contains demographic and travelling information for 891 of the Titanic's passengers, and the goal is often to predict passenger survival based on other attributes.

Overview
This dataset provides insights into the tragedy of the Titanic, offering details such as the names, ages, genders, ticket fares, cabins, and more about the passengers. The primary aim is to predict whether a passenger survived or not.

Analysis
This project employed several advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques to dive deep into the dataset and extract meaningful patterns. Here's a brief summary:

Correlation Matrix: Determined how different features relate to each other.

Machine Learning Models:

SVM with the kernel: A robust classifier that works well for both linear and non-linear data.
Naive Bayes: Used to understand the likelihood of events based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.
Logistic Regression: This model predicts the probability of a binary outcome.
K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN): Classified data points based on how their neighbours are classified.
Evaluation Metrics:

Confusion Matrix: Provides a summary of prediction results on a classification problem.
Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC): Visualizes the performance of a binary classifier.
Precision-Recall Curve: The trade-off between precision and recall for different threshold values.
SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations): This approach was employed to interpret the output of the machine learning models. SHAP values provide a unified measure of feature importance, making model predictions more transparent.

Conclusion
The Titanic dataset is not just about modelling. Itâ€™s a chance to reflect on the tragic events of the Titanic and shed some light on the patterns and scenarios that led to the survival or demise of its passengers. By using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, this analysis hopes to provide a more in-depth understanding of the dataset and the tragedy.
